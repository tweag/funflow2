-- | Hashing of S3 objects

--   This module allows us to fetch objects from S3, taking advantage of S3's
--   support for CAS to avoid the need to calculate our own content hashes.

--   - S3.Object (alias for Text)
--   - S3.ObjectInfo

-- | An S3 object is hashable whenever we have sufficient configuration to
--   access said object. To deal with this, we use reflection to reify a value
--   (the AWS configuration) into a class constraint.
--   To use this instance, you must reify the value using 'give':
--   @
--     cfg <- Aws.baseConfiguration
--     give cfg $ contentHash s3object
--   @
--
--   Since S3 is already content hashed, we do not need to actually hash the
--   object ourselves. In fact, we avoid fetching the object, and only
--   request the metadata including the content hash.
--   We incorporate the bucket and name into this to give extra guarantees on
--   uniqueness, but we may be better abolishing this to deduplicate files
--   stored in multiple places.
